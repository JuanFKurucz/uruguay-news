# AI Analysis Patterns & LangChain Integration

## Multi-Agent Analysis Architecture
Design LangChain/LangGraph workflows using Google Cloud services for scalable, serverless news analysis with 84%+ accuracy for Spanish sentiment analysis.

## Core Analysis Agents

### 1. Content Extraction Agent
- Use Cloud Functions with @functions_framework.http decorators
- Integrate MCP fetch servers for content retrieval
- Store extracted content in Firestore with automatic indexing
- Include metadata: source URL, extraction timestamp, content hash

### 2. Spanish Sentiment Analysis Agent
- Target 84%+ accuracy for Spanish sentiment analysis
- Use transformer models optimized for Spanish language
- Handle Uruguayan Spanish context and cultural idioms
- Implement Redis caching for model results (Memorystore)
- Include emotion detection alongside sentiment scoring

### 3. LangBiTe Bias Detection Agent
- Implement 300+ prompts for comprehensive bias detection
- Focus on Uruguayan political spectrum analysis
- Store detailed analysis in Firestore with BigQuery integration
- Include political lean, bias scores, and confidence levels

### 4. Entity Recognition Agent
- Extract people, organizations, and locations from Spanish text
- Combine SpaCy with Google Cloud Natural Language API
- Filter results for Uruguayan context relevance
- Store geographical and political entity mappings

### 5. Fact-Checking Agent
- Verify claims against trusted Uruguayan news sources
- Implement claim extraction and verification scoring
- Cross-reference with established fact-checking databases
- Provide supporting source links and confidence metrics

### 6. Memory & Context Agent
- Use Firestore for persistent context storage
- Implement vector embeddings for semantic memory
- Track conversation history and analysis patterns
- Enable context-aware analysis across sessions

## LangChain/LangGraph Patterns

### Agent Communication
- Design clear input/output contracts between agents
- Use structured data formats (Pydantic models)
- Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Enable parallel processing where possible

### Workflow Orchestration
- Use LangGraph for complex multi-step analysis workflows
- Implement conditional routing based on content type
- Design retry logic for failed analysis steps
- Track processing metrics for performance optimization

### Memory Management
- Implement conversation memory for context retention
- Use vector stores for semantic similarity search
- Design memory cleanup and archiving strategies
- Balance memory usage with analysis quality

## Performance Guidelines

### Response Time Targets
- API endpoints: <200ms response time
- Analysis pipelines: <5 seconds for complete analysis
- Real-time monitoring: <1 second for priority content
- Batch processing: Optimize for throughput over latency

### Accuracy Requirements
- Spanish sentiment analysis: 84%+ accuracy
- Bias detection: High precision with clear confidence scores
- Entity extraction: Focus on precision over recall
- Fact-checking: Conservative scoring with verified sources

### Scalability Patterns
- Use serverless architecture for auto-scaling
- Implement intelligent caching strategies
- Design stateless agents for horizontal scaling
- Monitor resource usage and optimize costs

## Error Handling & Monitoring

### Graceful Degradation
- Provide fallback responses when AI services fail
- Use cached results when real-time analysis unavailable
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging

### Quality Assurance
- Validate input data before processing
- Monitor model accuracy with test datasets
- Track processing success rates and failure patterns
- Implement automated quality checks

## Integration Guidelines

### Google Cloud Services
- Use Cloud Functions for serverless agent deployment
- Store results in Firestore with proper indexing
- Leverage Memorystore Redis for caching
- Monitor performance with Cloud Monitoring

### MCP Server Integration
- Use MCP servers for external tool interactions
- Implement proper authentication and rate limiting
- Handle MCP server failures gracefully
- Monitor MCP server health and performance

### External APIs
- Implement proper authentication for AI model APIs
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Handle rate limiting from external services
- Cache expensive API calls appropriately

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Add social media monitoring capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and batch processing
